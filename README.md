# ERP Coin Backend

Source code for the application and database layers.

## Usage

This is intended to be run with [Node.js] version 10.
Install required dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

A file named `config.json` must be created.
See [`config.template.json`] for an example.
See the following sections for more information on what is required.
To start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

[`config.template.json`]: config.template.json
[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/en/

### MySQL Server

A running MySQL server is required.
Use [`create-tables.sql`] to create the required tables.
[`create-users.sql`] is provided to create users for testing.
It will create a super admin with username `admin` and password `admin`, as well as six users named `darius`, `kyle`, `richard`, `sewis`, `tristan` and `ulrik`, each with the password `password`.

[`create-admin.sql`]: sql/create-admin.sql
[`create-tables.sql`]: sql/create-tables.sql

### Web3 Provider

The configuration in `config.template.json` is for a [Truffle] development provider.
Start it with:

```
npm run truffle develop
```

Then type `migrate --reset` to deploy the smart contract.

[Truffle]: http://truffleframework.com/

### TLS Certificate

A self-signed certificate, to be used for testing, can be generated with:

```
openssl req -new -x509 -out tls-cert.pem -keyout tls-key.pem -nodes -batch
```

Note that this certificate will have to be added to the browser.

### Coin Reward Parameters

The following parameters must be specified in `config.json`:

* `pointMaxAge` - The maximum time a point may stay on the map in milliseconds.
* `clearInterval` - The interval used to clear point exceeding the maximum time.
* `newPointInterval` - The minimum interval (in milliseconds) that a user must wait between submitting visited points.
* `nearRadius` - The radius (in metres) for which points are considered near a user's location.
* `expScale` - The number of nearby points are scaled by this factor before calculating the probability of earning a coin.
* `maxProbability` - The probability when there are no points nearby.

Every time a user submits a visited point, the probability of earning a coin is calculated as `maxProbability * exp(-numPoints * expScale)`.

## APIs

The following APIs are provided over HTTPS.
The content of all `POST` requests should be encoded as JSON, and responses will also be given as JSON.
Login sessions are managed using cookies.
The type `point` is an object with numeric fields `lat` and `lng`.

The API manages seven types of objects: users, admin users, super admin users, conservation areas, visited points, alerts and rewards.
In the requests below, `:user`, `:admin`, `:superadmin`, `:area`, `:point`, `:alert` and `:reward` are numeric IDs referencing the respective objects.
`:since` is a integer timestamp, and only objects newer than that time will be returned.
To list all objects, use the timestamp 0.
